<p>Dear Teachers,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It has now been two years since COVID-19
first started. The world education system including Singapore have been
affected. We have successfully overcome the challenges in our effort to
ensure continuous learning for our students. The challenges also did not
deter our educators in striving for excellence. Instead, it resulted in
a shift in our educational landscape where our educators are actively exploring
new skills and adapting to the new norms.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The many challenges faced also did
not dampen the spirit of our Malay Language (ML) educators. In their effort
to improve teaching and learning (T&amp;L) in the classroom, they have
been continuously seeking new knowledge and proactively attending the courses
offered by the Malay Language Centre of Singapore (MLCS). My sincere appreciation
and thanks to all our ML teachers for their continuous commitment to upgrade
themselves so that they can provide a meaningful and enjoyable learning
experience for our students.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The COVID-19 pandemic also saw rapid
changes taking place in our education landscape, which are aligned with
the current changes and development in education and technology. As a teacher
training centre, MLCS has also adapted accordingly with the changes brought
about by COVID-19. Almost all our core courses and professional development
programmes are offered online through the OPAL2.0 portal. The courses structure
have also been improvised using Malcom Knowles’ adult learning theory of
andragogy. The new structure also ensures that teachers are continuously
supported in their learning. From this year onwards, all courses offered
by MLCS will comprise of 3 parts that has been specially designed to provide
a more structured learning experience for our teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MLCS will also look into producing
e-publication or e-books for our T&amp;L resources. This move is necessary
in our effort to realise MLCS vision to be an excellent training centre
for ML teachers.&nbsp; In addition, this change will be well-aligned with
the skills and comfort level of our ML teachers in accessing information
using various technological affordances. The various e-publication will
also further facilitate the sharing of resources among teachers and allow
greater accessibility by teachers for their use in the classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In conclusion, may 2022 gives us the
strength to bring excellence and success in the T&amp;L of ML in Singapore.
For us in MLCS, we will be committed to stay relevant with the changes
in the education landscape. We are also determined to work closely with
all parties to cultivate the professional development excellence of our
teachers. With that spirit in mind, we welcome suggestions and feedback
in order to uphold the Malay language so that it will continue to be our
pride and glory.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
